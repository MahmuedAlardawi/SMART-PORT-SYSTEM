# Smart Port System - Project Overview

## Introduction
This project, conducted by students from King Abdulaziz University's Faculty of Computing and Information Technology, aims to design a smart port management system. The system facilitates the efficient handling of imports and exports for the fictional city of Oxagon, which is situated above water and requires innovative logistical solutions due to its unique location and industrial nature.

## Key Features

- **Automated Sorting and Tracking**: Divides port operations into specific tracks for different types of goods such as industrial materials, food, drugs, and personal shipments, enhancing the efficiency and safety of handling processes.
- **Intelligent Shipment Management**: Utilizes advanced algorithms to automatically assign and direct shipments to appropriate storage or processing tracks based on their contents.
- **Security and Compliance**: Implements robust security measures to scan and detect prohibited items within shipments, ensuring compliance with regulations.
- **Real-Time Tracking**: Offers real-time tracking of shipments for companies and individuals, ensuring transparency and up-to-date information on the status of each shipment.
- **Automated Weight Management**: Checks and manages the weight of shipments loaded onto ships to prevent overloading and ensure maritime safety.

## Technical Requirements

- **Technologies Used**: The system is likely built using a combination of software engineering tools and programming languages suitable for backend and frontend operations, database management, and possibly AI for sorting algorithms.
- **System Architecture**: Utilizes an N-tier architecture to separate concerns and allow efficient development and scaling of the port system.

## Objective

To revolutionize the way ports operate by integrating smart technologies that optimize operations, enhance security, and improve throughput efficiency at the port of Oxagon. This project not only aims to tackle the logistical challenges of a uniquely positioned city but also sets a benchmark for future smart port implementations globally.

## How to Use

1. **Setup and Configuration**: Detailed instructions for setting up the environment and configuring necessary software and tools to run the Smart Port system.
2. **Operation Guide**: A step-by-step guide on how to operate the system, including how to log in, track shipments, and manage shipment arrivals and departures.
3. **Security Protocols**: Explanation of the security measures and how to ensure the system remains compliant with international shipping and security regulations.
